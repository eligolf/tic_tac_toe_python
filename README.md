# Introduction
I created this game as a challenge to create the smallest and easiest possible code for the Tic Tac Toe game. The result is a version with PVP in 20 lines of code, and a version with a Negamax based AI in 38 lines of code. I also included well commented and PEP8 friendly versions in the repository with the suffix '_commented' to be able to see what is going on :) 

The requirements I had on the game was to have a "nice" playing experience, detect draw/win/loss and the ability to play again or exit after game is over. 

# How to start
You can run the desired game version in your IDE or from the console. No extra modules or installations needed! 

# How to play
When you play you are asked to input a number, which corresponds to a square as given in below picture. You can set the parameter user_turn to False if AI should play first.
