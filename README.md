# Introduction
I made this game as a challenge to create the smallest possible code for a Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The requirements on the game are as follows:

- A "nice" playing experience (ability to get user input and print the board after every move)
- Having an unbeatable AI as opponent.
- The ability to play again or exit after game is over 

# Setup
You can run the desired game version in your IDE or from the console, no extra modules or installations needed.

# How to play
When you play you are asked to input a number, which corresponds to a square as given in below picture. You can set the parameter user_turn to False if AI should play first. 

[1, 2, 3]<br>
[4, 5, 6]<br>
[7, 8, 9]<br>

# Results
The results you can see in the files ending with '_compressed'. I also included well commented and PEP8 friendly versions in the repository with the suffix '_commented' to be able to understand what is going on :)
